# Testing Routing

## Overview

Now that we've got our routes setup, it's crucial that when we make changes to our application that we don't break any existing route. That's where tests come in!

## Objectives

- Describe routing testing
- Write a test for routes and expect API calls/templates/Controllers

## Instructions

When we test our routes/states we should check that the URL is as we expect — that it's using the correct template and fetching the correct data that it needs.

To get all of our states' configuration, we can inject `$state` and use `$state.get` to retrieve the configuration object for that state. As we've registered all of our states with the `$stateProvider`, we can then access them all via `$state`.

An example test would look like:

```js
describe('Routes', function () {
	var $state;

	beforeEach(module('app'));

	beforeEach(inject(function ($injector) {
		$state = $injector.get('$state');
	}));

	describe('Settings', function () {
		var state;

		it('should have the correct URL', function () {
			state = $state.get('settings');

			expect(state.url).toEqual('/settings');
		});
	});
});
```

Here we're testing that the URL is correct. We can then test the `templateUrl` too:

```js
describe('Routes', function () {
	var $state;

	beforeEach(module('app'));

	beforeEach(inject(function ($injector) {
		$state = $injector.get('$state');
	}));

	describe('Settings', function () {
		var state;

		it('should have the correct URL', function () {
			state = $state.get('settings');

			expect(state.url).toEqual('/settings');
		});

		it('should use the correct template', function () {
            expect(state.templateUrl).toEqual('views/settings.html');
        });
	});
});
```

We'd then repeat this for all of our routes. This ensures that all of our routes are correct so that if we accidentally change a URL in the future, we won't be providing a bad user experience to the existing users!
